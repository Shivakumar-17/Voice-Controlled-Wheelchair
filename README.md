# Voice-Controlled Wheelchair using IoT Bluetooth

This project aims to develop a voice-controlled wheelchair system using IoT Bluetooth technology. The goal is to provide individuals with physical disabilities increased independence and freedom of movement. The project draws inspiration from the study titled "A Smart System for a Disabled Wheelchair Control Using Speech Recognition" by R. Idris l.

## Problem Statement

People with physical limitations face significant challenges when it comes to restricted movement and freedom. Conventional wheelchairs require manual control, which can be challenging or impossible for individuals with severe physical disabilities. This dependence on others for wheelchair control limits their independence and hampers their ability to navigate their surroundings.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Develop a voice-controlled wheelchair system using IoT Bluetooth technology.
2. Implement speech recognition to enable wheelchair control through voice commands.
3. Evaluate the stability and range of Bluetooth communication to ensure flawless and continuous wheelchair control.
4. Create a user-friendly interface for controlling the wheelchair using natural language commands.
5. Promote increased independence and self-reliance for individuals with mobility impairments.

## Methodology

The project will build upon the existing research on voice-controlled wheelchair systems. The study by R. Idris l. serves as a foundation for the development of the IoT Bluetooth-based wheelchair control system. The system will incorporate speech recognition technology to interpret voice commands and translate them into wheelchair movements.

## Expected Outcomes

The successful implementation of the voice-controlled wheelchair using an IoT Bluetooth module will yield the following outcomes:

1. Increased Independence: Individuals with mobility impairments will be able to operate the wheelchair independently, without relying on assistance from others. They can navigate their surroundings, move from one place to another, and perform various tasks using voice commands, promoting self-reliance and a sense of empowerment.

2. Improved User Experience: The voice-controlled interface will provide a more natural and user-friendly method of controlling the wheelchair. This will enhance the overall user experience and make wheelchair operation more intuitive and accessible.

3. Evaluation of Bluetooth Communication: The project will assess the stability and range of Bluetooth communication to ensure reliable and uninterrupted wheelchair control. This evaluation will contribute to the development of robust and efficient communication protocols for future wheelchair systems.

## Conclusion

The development of a voice-controlled wheelchair using IoT Bluetooth technology has the potential to revolutionize the mobility and independence of individuals with physical disabilities. By leveraging speech recognition and Bluetooth connectivity, this project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for wheelchair control. The successful implementation of this system will empower individuals with mobility impairments and enhance their quality of life.
